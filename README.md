## Getting Started
To use the app simply download to your local machine and in the command line from that directory run 'open index.html'

To run the tests you can run 'open SpecRunner.html' from the same base directory.

## Using the app
The app is quite self explanatory, increase / decrease the temperature and activate / deactivate the power saving function using the relevant buttons.

To find the current temperature in a given city type the city name into the form field and click submit.  The city temperature should automatically update.
